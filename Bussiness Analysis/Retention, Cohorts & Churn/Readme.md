# Retention, Cohorts & Churn

This project uses Google Spreadsheets and BigQuery to analyze customer retention, cohorts, and churn. It provides insights into subscription churn from a weekly retention perspective. The analysis tracks weekly subscription data, showing how many customers started their subscriptions in a particular week and how many remained active over the following six weeks.
