# Funnels

This project aims to analyze data from the Google Merch Shop using funnel analysis. The analysis includes five key events to assess customer behavior within the sales funnel.

The project explores differences and common trends among the top three countries, identified based on their total number of events. Insights are visualized in a funnel chart to highlight performance by country.

## Results and Conclusions

- Data suggests that all 3 countries face similar challenges in converting visitors to product views. Enhancing product visibility and site navigation could be beneficial in all markets. And, also, some sites of the products doesn't work.
- All 3 countries have minor differences and face a huge drop-off rate at this stage (around 78-80%). Make the cart process more intuitive and user-friendly. It could be that product was out of stock so customers couldnâ€™t add to cart.
- While all countries face quite simmilar challenges at each stage of the funnel, implemented improvements could benefit in all 3 markets. 
- Canada has the highest conversion rate out of top 3 countries.
