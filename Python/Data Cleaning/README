# Data Analysis of Cardiovascular Study Dataset: Logistic Regression
# An Example of Data Cleaning

This notebook, titled 'data_cleaning_python', is an excerption from an analysis of Cardiovascular Study dataset. It includes data loading and cleaning, and full analysis includes exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and insights. The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle. The dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information. It includes 3390 records and 15 attributes.

*The project goal* is to build a model that predicts whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD).

To achieve the goal, logistic regression in Python using the scikit-learn library is used in this project.

*The excerption goal* is to demonstrate an example of data cleaning, including the following steps:
- Conducting data inquiry.
- Changing data types of columns as needed.
- Checking for data inconsistencies in the dataset.
- Identifying unusual entries.
- Inspecting and handling missing values based on the specific column.
- Detecting and removing duplicates.
- Identifying outliers using boxplots and the IQR method.
- Standardizing column names to a consistent case format.
